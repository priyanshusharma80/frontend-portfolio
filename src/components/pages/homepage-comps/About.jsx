I'm from India, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Application from one of India's legacy institutes, "National Institute of Technology Raipur." I've been freelancing for the last 3 years, working with 30+ clients from 20+ different countries, including the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, and many more.
